  - any media that should go through the build process and url change with builds

- `src/public/`
  - `images` -> large photos or media libraries

## Auth: Login

1. configure in the laravel api:
   - create **.env.development** and **.env.production** in the laravel api 
   - configure **.env** of the laravel api
   - since we're using token auth we need to CSRF-exempt the all API routes in the **app.php** 
   - configure the **cors.php**'s allowed_origins
